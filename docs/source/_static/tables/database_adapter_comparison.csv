General points,"MySQL and MariaDB:

* Good for large databases
* Requires prior configuration hence longer set-up
* Easier to perform migrations i.e. database structure updates

On MySQL vs MariaDB, please refer to `some articles <https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/mariadb-vs-mysql>`_","* Good for small-medium databases
* The best to get started with - as it requires zero configuration. However, it has a major shortcoming:
* Cannot perform migrations. Only way to carry data to a new version is to export and then import"
