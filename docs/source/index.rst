What is it?
-----------
You are a school/college student. You have may assignments and test 
files. Now, you wish to organize them. Normally, you would put it in 
a folder hierachy. However, the hierachy can only classify the files
on one property. Say you made folders on the basis of teachers. Now
you wish to sort by subject. You will have to open individual 
subject tutors' folder to see what you want. Say you want all tests at 
once. Gurutracker aims to create a filesystem which is  non-hierachial 
and contains multiple attributes, on the basis of which files can be 
segregated.

Gurutracker is not only limited to academic material (although it was 
originally designed for that). Another use case is to store music 
files, which can be sorted on the basis of various attributes such as 
author, genre, language etc.
