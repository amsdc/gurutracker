## What is Gurutracker?
> **TL;DR**  Gurutracker is a non-hierachial file system which can be used to store files on basis of multiple properties. Designed for academic materials, but not limited to that.

You are a school/college student. You have may assignments and test files. Now, you wish to organize them. Normally, you would put it in a folder hierachy. However, the hierachy can only classify the files on one property. Say you made folders on the basis of teachers. Now you wish to sort by subject. You will have to open individual subject tutors' folder to see what you want. Say you want all tests at once. Gurutracker aims to create a filesystem which is non-hierachial and contains multiple attributes, on the basis of which files can be segregated.

Gurutracker is not only limited to academic material (although it was originally designed for that). Another use case is to store music files, which can be sorted on the basis of various attributes such as author, genre, language etc.
